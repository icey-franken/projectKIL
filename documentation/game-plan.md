Notes from meeting with Gordon on 8/10

* if you're working on an issue (like from kanban) you should make a branch for it that references the ticket for that particular issue. Make your commits to that branch as you go. When done, push that branch to gh. Then someone has to review the pull request and approve before it can be merged to master.
